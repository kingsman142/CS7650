    "### Perplexity\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know whether a language model is good? There are two basic approaches:\n",
    "1. Task-based evaluation (also known as extrinsic evaluation), where we use the language model as part of some other task, like automatic speech recognition, or spelling correcktion, or an OCR system that tries to covert a professor's messy handwriting into text.\n",
    "2. Intrinsic evaluation. Intrinsic evaluation tries to directly evalute the goodness of the language model by seeing how well the probability distributions that it estimates are able to explain some previously unseen test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what the textbook says:\n",
    "\n",
    "> For an intrinsic evaluation of a language model we need a test set. As with many of the statistical models in our field, the probabilities of an N-gram model come from the corpus it is trained on, the training set or training corpus. We can then measure the quality of an N-gram model by its performance on some unseen data called the test set or test corpus. We will also sometimes call test sets and other datasets that are not in our training sets held out corpora because we hold them out from the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "> So if we are given a corpus of text and want to compare two different N-gram models, we divide the data into training and test sets, train the parameters of both models on the training set, and then compare how well the two trained models fit the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "> But what does it mean to \"fit the test set\"? The answer is simple: whichever model assigns a higher probability to the test set is a better model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll implement the most common method for intrinsic metric of language models: *perplexity*.  The perplexity of a language model on a test set is the inverse probability of the test set, normalized by the number of characters. For a test set $$W = w_1 w_2 ... w_N$$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Perplexity(W) = P(w_1 w_2 ... w_N)^{-\\frac{1}{N}}$$\n",

    "$$ = \\sqrt[N]{\\frac{1}{P(w_1 w_2 ... w_N)}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = \\sqrt[N]{\\prod_{i=1}^{N}{\\frac{1}{P(w_i \\mid w_1 ... w_{i-1})}}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now implement the `perplexity(self, text)` function in `NgramModel`. A couple of things to keep in mind:\n",
    "1. Numeric underflow is going to be a problem, so consider using logs.\n",
    "2. Perplexity is undefined if the language model assigns any zero probabilities to the test set. In that case your code should return positive infinity - `float('inf')`.\n",
    "3. On your unsmoothed models, you'll definitely get some zero probabilities for the test set. To test you code, you should try computing perplexity on the training set, and you should compute perplexity for your language models that use smoothing and interpolation.\n",
