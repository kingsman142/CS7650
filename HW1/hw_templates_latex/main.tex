\textbf{Instructions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Submit your answers as a pdf file on Canvas. 
    \item We recommend students type answers with LaTeX or word processors. A scanned handwritten copy would also be accepted. If writing by hand, write as clearly as possible. No credit may be given to unreadable handwriting. 
    \item Write out all steps required to find the solutions so that partial credit may be awarded.
    \item The first question is meant for undergraduate students only while the last question is meant for graduate students only. Both these questions carry 5 pts each. Each of the other three questions is for 10 pts. There is no extra credit for answering additional questions than what is required.
    \item We generally encourage collaboration with other students. You may discuss the questions and potential directions for solving them with another student. However, you need to write your own solutions and code separately, and not as a group activity. Please list the students you collaborated with.
